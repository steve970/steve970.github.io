&lt;h3&gt;The Career Path Less Taken&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; My path to becoming a computer programmer was fairly unconventional by most standards. Aside from the twists and turns of life, I have experienced a full-range of different job titles and functions. Some might question how that looks to a potential employer, but I would argue that my breadth of knowledge and experience with successfully working pales in comparison to someone who has stayed on a more traditional career path.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; After I graduated from the University of Colorado with a degree in Business Administration with an emphasize in Marketing and a certificate in International Business, I moved to San Francisco and began my career as an inside-sales rep for a commercial real estate listing service. Needless to say, I wasn't cut out for telephone sales and transitioned over to an affiliate marketing company as a Marketing Coordinator, later being promoted to a Project Manager. At this point, I had worked for a large, corporate, publicly traded company and a small 15 person tech company. Having thrived in a position of data reporting, digital media, and project management, I switched gears completely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; I moved across country, left my cozy apartment in San Francisco and moved into an old barn in Wheatland, VA. I worked on an organic vegetable farm, what turned out to be a pivotal career point in my life. I realized how much I loved creating. I loved taking a blank canvas and making something beautiful, sharing it with the world, and receiving the feedback, good and bad. I worked the entire season from early April up to a first week of November. From this point, my desire to build something and grow a company took root.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; After the farming season, I moved back to Boulder and jumped into the start-up game. I gained employment at two early stage start up companies as an Account Manager. Ultimately both startups failed and I managing accounts and doing reporting wasn't filling the void I felt from the farming season. When I was working on the farm, I started a WordPress blog and began playing with css, html, and a little bit of php. Although different in the actual work done between coding and farming, there was a satisfaction with making something appear instantly on my computer screen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; When the second start-up let the staff go, I took a step back from the tech world and started working for a start-up restaurant opening in the area. I took a job as a busser and in my free time began the process of discovering where my passions lived. I began doing codeschool and codecademy in my free time and all the while, I moved up to Assistant General Manager of the restaurant I was working in. As the restaurant grew into a larger company, the pull to move into a different direction started and I jumped head first into computer programming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; I have since finished the Galvanize Fullstack Program and have begun working again with early stage startups. I love being a developer and the possibilities of where my career goes is endless...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;My website revisted...&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Mark this as my first official blog post of the New Year 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; When the new year began, I wanted to re-design and improve my website and one of the features that I wanted to add was a blog where I could talk about what I am learning, the growing pains of being a new developer, small victories, and the joys of my adventures along the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; If this is your first taste of getting to know me, you're in for a treat. I love learning new things, whether it is a new hobbie, trying a new gardening technique, picking up a new programming language, or going on long backpacking trips into the wilderness in a new area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; My personal website is one of those "new things". I discovered GitHub Pages nearly 2 years ago and went through a few different iterations of my website before settling on something that would just get me by. Fast forward to present day. When I was at the Boulder Ruby Monthly Meetup, I saw a presentation on Middleman and how easy it was to deploy static websites. After doing some research and I started down the path of building my website, compiling it down into a static site and deploying it through GitHub Pages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Some difficulties I had along the way: The old documentation and almost all the resources found online were out of date for the new External Pipeline in Middleman just released. I needed to use it to be able to properly load jQuery and any other plugins or external assets I may need down the line. So I figured out how to use WebPack for my external pipeline and was blown away with the ease of use and the power of being able to have that at my disposal when making a web application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; I know that was a very high level explanation of some of the difficulty had along the way and I promise, as this progresses and I knock off a few more tasks off the to do list, I will dive deeper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Until then, so long, thanks for stopping by!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
